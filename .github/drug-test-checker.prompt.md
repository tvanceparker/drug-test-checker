You are a senior android application developer. You have extensive experience with building android applications that scrap webpages, and display them on the application. You are familiar with various libraries and tools for web scraping, as well as best practices for displaying web content in a user-friendly manner. You can go to the website and check it out if you want, the raw HTML for the web scraping is in there, please give any insights on other things you want to do with this if you need to (like different ways of doing things or improving the user experience or a better way then scraping the webpage). Please feel free to give me your expert insights to things along the way and we will do this. 

**Goal**
To build a android application that see's if I have to go into to drug test on that day

**Requirements**
- Able to take two parameters a 6 digit pin and the first 4 of last name
- Able to display the result in a user-friendly manner
- Able to handle errors and exceptions gracefully
- Needs to be in react native, expo.
- Needs to happen everyday at 3:10am in Boise/America Timezone (MST?)
- Needs to be able to run in the background and send notifications and emails just in case
- Needs to be able to access the internet to check for drug test appointments
- Needs to be able to take those two credential parameters and use them and saves them, should be able to be used for someone else, so no hardcoded credentials, but they will be saved and can be changed if needed to.


**Contraints**
- Needs to be done in react native, expo and possibly python for easy web scrapping
- Needs to be stored in app, as a CSV or something similar, whatever you would recommend.
- Only needs to happen once a day at the specified time.
- Can be manually ran and looked at
- Needs to keep logs of all requests and responses locally and able to view them
- This is a local only applicaiton, no database required for it.

**How the test check is done manually**
- User goes to drugtestcheck.com
- User inputs their 6 digit pin in the input label PIN
- User inputs their first 4 digits of the last name (has to be titled)
- User clicks the submit button
- Response says either 'You are' or 'You are not required to test today'
- If check was outside of the times of 3am to 2pm it will say 'Please try again during your agency's call-in timeframe.'


**HTML notes**

- The PIN input box is this in the raw html ```<input type="code" class="form-control" name="callInCode" id="callInputCode" aria-describedby="callInputCode" maxlength="7">```
- The Last Name input box is this in raw html ```<input type="lettersLastName" class="form-control" name="lastName" id="lettersInputLastName" maxlength="4">```
- The submit button is this in raw html ```<button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>```


- The html for the replay is structured in the page like so either the formaer or latter
```<label for="reply" > You are required to test today, August 31st, 2025</label>
<label for="replay" > You are not required to test today, August 31st, 2025</label>```


**Success Criteria**
- Able to build a react native, expo application that meets all the requirements and contraints listed above.
- We will run the expo test server thing first to make sure it all works and iterate from there.
- Able to implement background tasks to check for drug test appointments daily at 3:10am MST.
- Able to send notifications and emails in case of drug test appointments.
- Able to store user credentials securely and allow for updates.
- Able to log all requests and responses locally.


**Other Notes**
- Android application that I can build and then run on my device
- Maybe on the playstore one day just for fun
- User-friendly interface with clear instructions and feedback
- Make it look nice and intuitive, with a clean layout and easy navigation, but not really plain, style is with your style
- At the end go ahead, and make a .gitignore and a github repo for it under my email (you should be signed into everything already)
